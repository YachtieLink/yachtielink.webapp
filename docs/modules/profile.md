# Profile

One-line: Private profile hub with photo upload, identity card, strength meter, section grid, AI summary, contact settings, social links, section visibility controls, and saved profiles with folders.

## Current State

- Profile page: working — server-rendered dashboard at `/app/profile` showing hero card, photo strip, personal details card (age/nationality/smoking/tattoos/license/travel docs), strength meter, section grid with chip previews for skills/hobbies, and empty-state prompts
- Profile photo: working — upload with client-side crop (react-image-crop), 800px square output, JPEG/PNG/WebP, 5 MB max
- Multi-photo gallery: working — `user_photos` table, ordered strip with "Main" badge on first, up to 9 photos (reorder via API)
- Work gallery: working — `user_gallery` table with optional caption and yacht association, up to 30 items
- Display name / handle / full name: set during onboarding, editable later
- Handle: validated via regex (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$`), 3-30 chars, uniqueness checked via `handle_available` RPC
- Bio: free-text, editable at `/app/about/edit`
- Primary role + departments: set during onboarding, editable
- Contact info (phone, WhatsApp, contact_email, location): working at `/app/profile/settings` with per-field inline show/hide toggles. `contact_email` is separate from auth email — falls back to `email` if null.
- Profile settings page: rewritten with 4 sections — Identity (name/handle/role/departments), Contact (phone/whatsapp/contact_email/location with inline toggles), Personal (DOB/home country with toggles + `show_nationality_flag` SVG flag toggle), Layout (view mode selector). Scrim/accent/template settings removed from UI (backlog item for rebuild with live preview).
- Display settings: View Mode (profile/portfolio/rich_portfolio with Pro lock) on settings page. Hero Scrim presets and Accent Colour swatches removed from UI — values preserved in DB but no editing UI. `rich_portfolio` coerced to `portfolio` on save for non-Pro users.
- Section visibility: working — PATCH endpoint toggles individual sections (about, experience, endorsements, certifications, hobbies, education, skills, photos, gallery) via `section_visibility` JSONB column
- Social links: working — up to 7 links (Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, X, Facebook, website) via PATCH API
- AI summary: working — generated via OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` from bio + attachments + endorsements; editable after generation; `ai_summary_edited` flag prevents accidental overwrite; rate-limited to 10/hour
- Profile strength meter: working — computed from 9 signals (photo, role, bio, yacht, cert, endorsement, hobby, education, social link); shows score, label, and smart CTA pointing to the most impactful next action
- Saved profiles + folders: working — save/unsave other users' profiles, organize into custom folders with emoji
- Hobbies: working — bulk upsert up to 10 items with name + optional emoji
- Education: working — CRUD with institution, qualification, field of study, date range
- Extra skills: working — bulk upsert up to 20 items with name + optional category
- Onboarding guard: profile page redirects to `/onboarding` if `onboarding_complete` is false
- RLS: user queries use anon key scoped to own row; profile photo uploads go through `uploadProfilePhoto` helper
- Rate limiting: profile edit (30/min/user), AI summary (10/hr/user), file upload (20/hr/user)

## Decisions

**2026-03-29** — D-038: Auth email and contact email are separate. `contact_email` column on users table for CV/profile display; auth `email` used only for login. All public-facing read paths use `contact_email ?? email` fallback. Scrim/accent/template settings removed from UI — existing DB values preserved, to be rebuilt with live preview in a future sprint. CV-only fields (smoking, tattoos, license, travel docs) live on the CV tab, not profile settings. — Ari + Claude Code

**2026-03-08** — D-036: Current build target is Phase 1A — profile, CV import, yacht entities, employment attachments, colleague graph, endorsements, public profile, PDF snapshot, paid presentation upgrades. Recruiter access and later features deferred. — Ari

**2025-11-20** — D-007: Identity is free infrastructure; presentation is paid and cosmetic only. Paid scope is cosmetic presentation only — templates, polish, watermark removal. — Ari

## Next Steps

- [ ] Crew availability toggle with 7-day expiry (D-027)
- [x] Separate contact email from auth email (`contact_email` column)
- [ ] Rebuild scrim/accent/template settings with live preview
- [ ] Profile analytics (basic: view count) — gated to Pro tier
- [ ] Cert expiry alerts (cron job exists at `app/api/cron/cert-expiry/`)
- [x] Bump MAX_PHOTOS_PRO 9 → 15 (Sprint 11c — shipped PR #107)

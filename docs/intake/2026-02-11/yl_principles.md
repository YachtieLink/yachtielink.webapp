# Yachtielink – System Principles

These principles are invariant across all phases.

---

## 1. Trust is the product
The platform's value is the reliability of its signals. Features, growth, and revenue are secondary to signal integrity. If trust degrades, nothing else matters.

## 2. Crew safety is asymmetric
Crew are mobile and vulnerable. Yachts have institutional power. The system privileges crew in trust conflicts because the power imbalance already favours employers.

## 3. Freeze before corruption
When incentives threaten trust integrity, the system freezes rather than bends. A paused feature is recoverable. Corrupted trust is not.

## 4. There is no market for reputation
Trust cannot be bought, sold, accelerated, or suppressed through payment. This is absolute. Any exception destroys the system's reason to exist.

## 5. Legibility changes behavior
Making trust signals visible changes how people act. This is a feature, not a bug—but it must be handled carefully. Visibility creates accountability and also creates gaming incentives.

## 6. Growth is capped by trust
User acquisition must not outpace trust graph formation. A large user base with hollow profiles is worse than a small user base with meaningful signals.

## 7. Phase 1 work is permanent
Identity schemas, yacht graph structure, and endorsement mechanics built in Phase 1 persist into Phases 2 and 3. There is no "we'll fix it later" for foundational infrastructure.

## 8. The founder is optional
The system must be designed to survive founder absence, acquisition pressure, or leadership change. Principles are documented, not personal. The constitution outlives the founders.

## Canonical Monetisation Rule (System Law)

**You can't pay to be more trusted. You can only pay to present yourself better.**

This rule is absolute.

Money must never:
- increase trust
- suppress trust
- delay trust
- influence credibility outcomes
- alter endorsement eligibility

Money may only:
- improve visual presentation
- improve distribution polish
- improve formatting, layout, and analytics

If this rule is threatened, monetisation freezes before trust bends.

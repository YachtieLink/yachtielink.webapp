# Yachtielink — Explicit Non-Goals

These exclusions are binding for Phase 1 unless explicitly noted.

---

## Not an employer-pays hiring platform

**Why:** When employers pay for hiring, the platform optimises for employer satisfaction over crew truth. Hiring incentives only corrupt trust when there's a financial relationship with one side of the transaction.

**What this prevents:**
- Paid job postings or promoted listings
- Employer-only accounts (everyone must have a full crew profile)
- Placement fees or recruitment revenue
- Recruiter tools or agency dashboards
- Algorithmic job matching that obscures graph relationships
- Any revenue derived from hiring transactions

**What this allows:**
- Free job postings by users with full profiles (crew hiring crew)
- Applications via profile (graph-aware, shows mutual colleagues/IRL connections)
- "Available for work" visibility to network
- Direct messaging between poster and applicant

**Note:** Captains and HODs are crew too. When they post jobs, their full profile and trust graph are visible. Both sides have skin in the game. This is peer hiring, not a marketplace.

Phase 1 hiring surfaces are constrained by design. Future phases may leverage the graph for hiring workflows. No Phase 1 constraint should be interpreted as a permanent prohibition.

## Not a rating or review platform

**Why:** Star ratings and free-text reviews create coercion dynamics, legal exposure, and false precision.

**What this prevents:**
- Numeric scores (1–5 stars, percentages, rankings)
- Open review boxes where anyone can write anything
- "Rate your experience" prompts
- Aggregated reputation scores
- Any UI that summarises someone as "highly rated" or "poorly rated"

**Note:** Endorsements are contextual, gated by shared employment, and never reduced to a number.

## No global discovery feed

**Why:** Global discovery mechanics incentivise engagement hacks and ranking pressure that corrupt signal integrity.

**What this prevents:**
- Public explore feeds or global timelines
- Algorithmic content surfacing or trending lists
- Viral sharing mechanics
- Any feature designed to maximise time-on-platform

**What this allows:**
- A graph-bounded, chronological timeline
- Posts, interactions, and milestones within a user's network
- Comments within the network boundary

**Note:** The timeline is bounded to people you know (colleagues, IRL connections, and contacts). There is no public discovery layer.

---

## Not an agency replacement

**Why:** Re-centralising power recreates the industry failure modes this system exists to escape.

**What this prevents:**
- Acting as an intermediary in hiring
- Taking fees for placements
- "Verified by Yachtielink" hiring stamps
- Exclusive crew pools
- Any feature that makes Yachtielink a gatekeeper

**Note:** Agencies may use the platform like anyone else. They get no special access or tools.

---

## Not reputation management software

**Why:** No tools will exist to delay, suppress, buy, rehabilitate, or optimise trust outcomes through payment.

**What this prevents:**
- "Remove this endorsement" paid services
- "Boost my profile" trust features
- "Dispute resolution" that favours payers
- SEO-style "reputation repair" tools
- Any feature that lets money influence how trustworthy someone appears

**Note:** Presentation polish (templates, formatting) is allowed. Trust outcomes are not.

---

## Not a discovery platform

**Why:** Discovery mechanics create ranking incentives that inevitably corrupt signal quality.

**What this prevents:**
- Public search or browse of all profiles
- "Top crew" or "featured profiles" lists
- Algorithmic recommendations
- Profile visibility tied to activity or payment

**Note:** Profiles and timelines are visible via direct link or within a user's network. There is no public browse or global discovery.

---

## Not a messaging platform

**Why:** The product is identity and trust, not communication. Messaging is a utility, not a feature.

**What this prevents:**
- Group chats or channels
- Broadcast messaging to non-contacts
- Read receipts, typing indicators, presence
- Any messaging feature that encourages engagement over utility

**Note:** Messaging exists between contacts and known colleagues/IRL connections. It is deliberately minimal.

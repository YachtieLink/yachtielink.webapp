# Phase 1 Close-Out Checklist

**Goal:** Ship the complete Phase 1 product with a clean codebase. Three weeks, cleanup integrated into every wave.

**How to use this file:** At session start, read this checklist. Find the first unchecked item. That's your task. Update the checkboxes and notes as you go. If you're blocked, check the Blockers section.

## Blockers (resolve before anything moves)

- [x] **D1-D8 design decisions** — Resolved 2026-03-25. D1: two-step normalize+fuzzy (maritime cert alias map). D2: 1mo overlap OK. D3: country name. D4: libphonenumber-js. D5: deferred post-launch. D6: scale, no h-scroll ever. D7: list-based. D8: upsert on user+yacht+role.
- [x] **Vercel Pro upgrade** — Purchased 2026-03-25 on YachtieLink credit card (ari@yachtie.link). Env config TBD at deploy time.
- [x] **Legal business address** — Deferred. Using ari@yachtie.link as GDPR contact until a physical desk is secured.

- [ ] Run `/review`, update drift baseline

### Session 3 — Wave 1: Data Integrity + CV Consolidation ✅
- [x] Cert/attachment dedup (D1, D8 decisions applied)

- [x] **Cleanup:** Remove unused props from `CvImportWizard` (`existingAttachments`, `existingCerts`, `existingEducation`)
- [x] Run `/review`, update drift baseline
- [x] **Baseline target:** legacy-cv-path errors → 0

### Session 4 — Wave 2: Public Profile + Shared Read Models ✅
- [x] Hero fields fix (age + sea time in hero; `available_for_work` badge on public profile)
- [x] CV 404 fix (`cv_public` null treated as public, consistent across page/download/card)
- [ ] Responsive layout fixes (deferred — needs D6 transform:scale implementation)
- [x] Share/download functionality (already shipped — verified still working)
- [x] **Cleanup:** Extract shared CV section query builder (`getCvSections` in `lib/queries/profile.ts`)
- [x] **Cleanup:** Move viewer-relationship logic to `getViewerRelationship` shared helper

- [x] Run `/review` (Sonnet + Opus) + `/yachtielink-review`, update drift baseline
- [x] **Baseline target:** weak-typing warnings reduced, profile `any[]` eliminated
